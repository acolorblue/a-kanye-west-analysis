              <p class='unread'>My study of Kanye runs parallel to my study of Stanley Kubrick, the photographer Jeff Wall, the industrial designer Jony Ive, the sculptor Damien Hirst, Steve Jobs & Malcolm X. I mean literally these people damn near raised me as I found strong kinship in them from an understanding of and relation to a shared motive. What we see partaking with Kanye is the amplification of right motive, wrong approach. Wrong approach also goes into the context of lack of proper information, and also a lack of care to receive proper information, which plays a bit into our culture of desensitization. We've all seen Kanye previously show his love for Malcolm X, “Power” is linked to being inspired from the scene in the Spike Lee film where Denzel was outside the hospital with a mob of black people, in which he silenced them by raising his hand, pointed in a direction which they all proceeded to follow, then the white police officer remarks “That’s too much power for one man to have.”</p>

              <p class='unread'>We’re aware of the occasional name dropping in his other songs, this also happens during his sermons at concerts with one of the last taking place in September 2016 when he felt disrespected by Kid Cudi he stopped the show to rant “Why y’all gotta be coming at me??

              <p class='unread'>His admiration of Malcolm does not stem from an ideological/theoretical analysis of his speeches and seeing how they apply to the current social/economic/political life of black people locally and globally. Kanye’s love of Malcolm X is the same love he has for Donald Trump, he simply loves the fact that they both said what they wanted. His prior reference to Trump was in a November 2016 sermon, resulting from his feelings of anger at radio stations for playing the same annoying pop music everyone was tired of as he wanted to hear more Frank Ocean and Cudi. The excerpt goes “Radio fuck you!!! Oh yeah i’m on my Trump shit tonight! Radio fuck you!!!!! Yeah i’m taking his lead! Imma just say how I say — Imma just say — Imma just be Ye and win! Imma take his lead! Radio fuck you!!!”</p>

              <p class='unread'>Yeah that’s that dragon energy shit he talking about. Through his own confession he admits his lack of understanding in Trump's policies and I don't believe he truly has the desire to become familiar with them.</p>
              <p class='unread'>That similar characteristic is what Malcolm stated he respected in Conservatives versus Liberals, which is that the Conservatives showed their teeth, *expanded on in his fox vs wolf analogy. Speaking in a 1964 interview on Barry Goldwater (A candidate backed by the KKK) he states, "If Goldwater ever becomes president, one thing his presence in the White House will do — It will make black people in America have to face up to facts probably for the first time in many many years and this in itself is good. In that, Goldwater is a man who is not capable of hiding his racist tendencies and at the same time he is not capable of even pretending to negros that he is their friend, so this will have the tendency to make the negro probably for the first time do something to stand on their own feet and solve their own problem instead of putting themselves in a position to be mislead, misused, exploited by the whites who pose as liberals only for the purpose of getting the support of the negro.”</p>

              <p class='unread'>It’s similar to the argument of the honest thief, where one can say “At least he is honest.” (which he isn’t) The difference between Kanye’s and Malcolm’s statement is Kanye falls short of the “This makes it crystal clear as to who our enemies are” after thought. He fails to realize that it goes beyond the characteristic. It goes to the children in Syria with their hospitals and schools blown up across the street from them. It goes to all the fathers and mothers deported and those constantly living in fear of the abrupt separation of their families forever. That’s family man, that is often times the only thing that gives people some sort of true meaning and worth in their lives. For black people in America, police brutality is one of our biggest nuisance and it goes with the enabling of the police officers that support this man and feel empowered to physically exercise their racist views with no repercussions that leaves niggas like me dead with 15 accidental bullets in my chest. He enables that shit and is letting himself be used as a prop while Trump throws out the condescending “lowest unemployment” like we all just a whole buncha boot-licking-lazy-watermelon-eating negros waiting for massa to give us something to do.</p>
              
              <p class='unread'>His motive of love and wanting to unify all people is pure, but he lacks the understanding in realizing the actions and policies of the other side he desires to unify is in complete opposition to the literal survival and liberty of his own people, which was often a critique Martin Luther King received from Malcolm X.</p>

              <p class='unread'>Black people have never had a problem loving. In fact, this contributes to how we ended up in this position, by loving so damn much. These are the same people who get their skulls crushed and turn around and say “Why can’t we all just get along?” Is it not the natives love that got their land stolen from them? One side made it a war, and they make this very clear in their rhetoric of “taking our country back” — taking back their country from who?? The other side is then by default placed in the position of the opposition in a war which is really just out of self defense and a refusal to be treated as less than human beings or as if their life has no value and this is something so many people who bring the argument of “encouraging dialogue” fail to understand. One side doesn’t add the survival of your life into their agenda and the other is in response simply defending their birthright of liberty & autonomy like what kind of fucking dialogue are you looking for? The motive of wanting to encourage independent thought is honest but you see no one actually cares about people thinking freely, in fact, everyone wants that. Bruh most people are deadass lost and constantly searching for answers, so anything that could help minimize the confusion we feel and make some sense of the world is deeply sought after. It’s a similar reason as to why we may study philosophy or join a religion, but is using the shield of “freethinking” to say dumb shit not parallel to a white person calling you a nigger then pleading freedom of speech? Your freethinking, freedom of speech & "political incorrectness" only becomes a problem when it threatens the actual psychological and physical well-being of other human beings.</p>
              
              <p class='unread'>A strong willed person with a lack of proper information is a very dangerous human being. What happens when niggas getting bullied at school snap and get straps? Does one understand the desire for revenge? Yes! Does everyone get shot? Yes! His lack of care for proper information is lazy and disappointing, yet also plays a bit into our culture of desensitization which we all experience on various levels. In truth we are all victims of witnessing the same devastating scenarios play out over and over again. Do I know how many mass shootings have taken place since the Aurora Century 16 Movie Theater shooting? No! Do I get angry every time then subconsciously try to block it out? Yes! How many of us still speak about the Orlando shooting? 49 people died man. 49 fucking human beings! Can we even count 35 family members of the top of our head? Did another mass shooting happen? How many of us still think about the Las Vegas shooting? It’s wild like bro just got a choppa and started unloading on niggas from a hotel room like he playing gta and a week later we stopped speaking about it. In the context of police brutality, for black people it can fill you with deep rage and gradually become numbing to see the constant cycle of another nigga dying and another and another and nothing changing. Just more niggas dying and the same arguments/protests being made. Nigga we are in an abusive relationship with the United States government. Desensitization & numbness can often be a way to subconsciously cope for the immediate moment when one feels hopeless. The difference between our desensitization and Kanye’s is ours still threatens our livelihood, where as Kanye’s wealth and fame shields him from the day to day experience of most black people. It gives him the privilege of being able to “agree to disagree” because it is not him being choked on the cold concrete pavement. It is not him being trapped in private prisons working in slave-like exploitation for a dime bag he had on him 4 years ago that we now see Kate and Billy opening up their laced cupcake business for. We can agree to disagree on your best album, not on my survival.</p> 
              
              <p class='kanye-wiz-tweets unread'>I actually don’t think he ever has. Due mainly to his ego threatened, I believe he meant what he said about Wiz & Amber prior to the release of TLOP because it was just too personal,</p>

               <p class='kanye-wiz-tweets unread'> you don’t fabricate feelings like that. So if it isn’t controversy for the sake of it to promote art, it leaves us right back at the initial devastating reaction which is that he believes in this.</p>
              
              <p class='unread'>Kanye's loud profess of slavery being a choice is indisputably foolish but actually of character. Did 'Yeezus' not solidify our understanding of his desire to not be controlled? He states “For 400 years?? That sound like a choice! You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all??”</p>

              <p class='unread'>which is really just saying “Why didn’t you nig-nog-negros try and break free? Why didn’t y’all try and tear this whole shit down??” For one, *many did and he should know that before using Nat Turner's name in vain. For two, why doesn’t everyone quit the job they hate? Or drop out of the school that’s taking a major toll on their emotional well being? Is it not so simple? Kanye fails to add in the other factors that play a role in the psyche of human beings, which includes the fear of uncertainty, the misery and depression of hopelessness, the fear of losing loved ones, and in a capitalist society, the fear of being poor. I mean these are real questions that go through people's brains, and that doesn’t make them weak, it actually makes them human. Understading what it means to thoroughly go through these questions and be at peace with them is a personal luxury because this is far from something we are truly taught as a society so to use it as a measuring stick for all is misguided and quite elitist. People should be inspired to be fearless, not talked down on for a lack of. If they have never witnessed it, how can they even emulate that? We applaud the ones that revolted and goddamn as we should because they showed us the light, but that does not give us the right to disrespect a mother who from birth knew nothing else than violent exploitation and was truly not prepared for all consequences in terror of losing her children, perhaps the only thing that might have provided her some comfort in the cancerous system of slavery.</p>
              
              <p class='unread'>The argument of “Why pull the ‘race card’?” is also idiotic. First of all who made these cards? Can I get a reshuffle of the deck my nigga why you give me poverty & lead paint walls with a wild card of self hatred? Why do y’all only lock your car door when you see me walk by? Because it applies! Ignoring the damages & effects of slavery ignores the entire structure of our present existence. How can we strategically move from where we are if we don’t critically examine and analyze what got us here? Candace Owens also heavily polluted Kanye’s mind just like we saw others who are aware of his lack of information do through his texts. I know she believes the shit she says, but I also believe she’s an opportunist who is latching onto Kanye’s strong believe in her rhetoric (Which is just cause she loudly saying something different) to promote her own agenda (I know y'all seen how quick she pulled up on that TMZ chair to talk and left Kanye yelling bullshit on the side) and will disregard him when he inevitably goes against her political ambitions just as the many republicans did immediately after he tweeted about Emma Gonzalez. Yo do you not see this whole 40 year old man talking about getting liposuction due to his fear of being called fat? Have you spoken to him about creativity? About product design? About his favorite Michael Jackson video or his favorite shoe as a child? Is this your friend? Aye bruh John Arthur-Liberal Legend confirmed Kanye don’t read so who else put these statistics of “Black on Black” crime (Dumb cause crime is based on proximity) in this man's brains other than someone who preaches to blacks in a room full of white people cheering some bullshit “Pull yourself up by the bootstrap” Nigga you stole my boots and put a bullet in my leg, fuck you. A black man just told you about the real physical dangers on his existence that really can cause anxiety and paranoia in a police state and your response is a snarky “Okay I’m not enslaved so I don’t mean to insult his reality” *yeah you can choke. This is someone who condescendingly said economics should obviously always come first before social issues because “We don’t want to become a third world country while screaming about pronouns”</p>

              <p class='unread'> but the approach of grabbing the mic from her in the middle of her speech to state who's work was better was reactionary, where as revolutionary could have been actually starting his own award show. An artist, specifically the most influential of their time, with their own award show and in complete creative control over the quality of work that gets rewarded? That’s really going against the grain. Who needs who? Do the artists need the award show? Or does the award show need them? The artists can still make music without the award show, the award show can not continue without the artists. Ironic enough, the George Bush moment was actually also another scenario of right motive, wrong approach, stating in his apology, “Even in these times where I was considered to have done something so wrong, my motivation was from a good place.”</p>

              <p class='unread'>We love and cherish it as we should because of its authenticity and fearlessness, but what did that moment truthfully do? It showed us that he had the courage to speak his mind and most importantly loudly express the grievances of Black America, but did we not already know that? Did “We Don’t Care” “Never Let Me Down” “Family Business” “Heard Em Say” and “Crack Music” not tell us this? So what did it truly solve? Examining it in hindsight he stated it was reactionary, yet at the same time as black people this is often our only way of expressing ourselves due the grievances and anger immediately felt added to the already bottled up emotions and trauma we carry daily (R.I.P. Erica Garner), but in the long run it’s puts us right back in the same position because it builds nothing substantial. We indirectly wait for the next devastation to occur as we see this with the protests that follow the state complicit murders of black men, women and children. Organizational puts us in the position where we have already made up our minds and it’s set in stone. It’s a position of no matter what, this is what we are working towards as a whole and this is our end goal. (Full love, respect and support to all grassroots organizations currently existing)</p>
              
              <p class='unread'>We see that these situations have repeatedly occurred throughout Kanye’s career which ended up branding him as an asshole when in reality he’s truly trying to do the right thing, his faulty approaches just end up hurting him but what is way bigger than him is that it also ends up hurting millions of other people who are affected by his power and his lack of realization is even more devastating. When uncontrollably consumed with a vision of the world that inevitably affects the lives of other human beings, anything less than speaking from the heart is an inauthentic and unacceptable compromise, yet it is also your duty and responsibility to minimize as much confusion as possible and articulate the ideas because as long as people believe in the same vision they will follow, just show them clearly where they are going.</p>
